\section{Application scenario}
\label{sec:scenarios}

Flow and NDN-IoT framework are designed as an example to illustrate what the whole picture of deploying and using an NDN-IoT application would look like to users and service providers.
During the design phase, we envisioned the following practical application scenarios.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Adding new gateway devices to home} 
\item \emph{Installing the application binary and initial configuration} 
\item \emph{Replacing a device without changing application-level label} 
\end{itemize}
